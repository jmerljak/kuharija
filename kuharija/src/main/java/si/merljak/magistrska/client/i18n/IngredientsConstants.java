The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white (known alternatively as albumen or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. Prior to fertilization, the yolk together with the germinal disc is a single cell, one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye. As a food, yolks are a major source of vitamins and minerals. They contain all of the egg's fat and cholesterol, and about one-half of the protein. If left intact while cooking fried eggs, the yellow yolk surrounded by a flat blob of whites creates a distinctive sunny-side up form. Mixing the two components together before frying results in a pale yellow mass, as in omelettes and scrambled eggs. (from Wikipedia)",

The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized). Egg white consists primarily of about 90% water into which is dissolved 10% proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats), egg white contains almost no fat, and carbohydrate content is less than 1%. Egg whites contain just over 50% of the protein in the egg.

		"MARGARINE_DESC", "Margarine is a semi-solid emulsion composed mainly of hydrogenated or refined vegetable fats and water.

(from Wikipedia)",
		"MELON_DESC", "Melons are members of the plant family Cucurbitaceae with edible, fleshy fruit (e.g. gourds or cucurbits). Although the melon is a botanical fruit (specifically, a berry), some varieties may be considered culinary vegetables rather than fruits. (from Wikipedia)",
		"MILK_DESC", "Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food. As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from mammals and used as food for humans. (from Wikipedia)",

Factors such as climate, seasons and soil composition may affect the aromatic oils present, and this effect may be greater than the differences between the various species of plants. Among the chemical compounds contributing to the flavour are carvacrol, thymol, limonene, pinene, ocimene, and caryophyllene. (from Wikipedia)",

Chicken eggs frequently dominate as the source of the liquid component in fresh pasta. (from Wikipedia)",
		"PEANUT_DESC", "The peanut, or groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), is a species in the legume or bean family (Fabaceae). The peanut was probably first domesticated and cultivated in the valleys of Paraguay. Peanuts are known by many other local names such as earthnuts, ground nuts, goober peas, monkey nuts, pygmy nuts and pig nuts.[3] Despite its name and appearance, the peanut is not a nut, but rather a legume. Peanuts have many uses. They can be eaten raw, used in recipes, made into solvents and oils, medicines, textile materials, and peanut butter, as well as many other uses. Popular confections made from peanuts include salted peanuts, peanut butter (sandwiches, peanut candy bars, peanut butter cookies, and cups), peanut brittle, and shelled nuts (plain/roasted). Salted peanuts are usually roasted in oil and packed in retail-size plastic bags or hermetically sealed cans. Dry roasted salted peanuts are also marketed in significant quantities. Peanuts are often a major ingredient in mixed nuts because of their relative cost compared to Brazil nuts, cashews, walnuts, and so on. (from Wikipedia)",

It is sometimes called a water dough or d√©trempe. The gaps that form between the layers are a result of the puff pastry rising as the water evaporates into steam during the baking process. Piercing the dough will prevent excessive puffing, and crimping along the sides will prevent the layers from flaking all of the way to the edges. (from Wikipedia)",

Natural vanilla gives a brown or yellow color to preparations, depending on the concentration. Good-quality vanilla has a strong aromatic flavor, but food with small amounts of low-quality vanilla or artificial vanilla-like flavorings are far more common, since true vanilla is much more expensive.
